```
## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/miishthiii/ExpenseTracker.git
cd ExpenseTracker

```
### 2. Configure Database

---

## Create the required tables in your Oracle database:

CREATE TABLE users (
    id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR2(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE expenses (
    id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id NUMBER REFERENCES users(id),
    description VARCHAR2(255),
    amount NUMBER(10,2),
    expense_date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);

CREATE TABLE incomes (
    id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id NUMBER REFERENCES users(id),
    amount NUMBER(10,2),
    income_date DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE
);

---

### Create sequences (if not already present):

CREATE SEQUENCE users_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE;
CREATE SEQUENCE expenses_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE;
CREATE SEQUENCE incomes_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE;

# Update your hibernate.cfg.xml with your Oracle username, password, and connection URL.

CREATE SEQUENCE users_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE;
CREATE SEQUENCE expenses_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE;
CREATE SEQUENCE incomes_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1 NOCACHE NOCYCLE;


---


### 3.Build the Project

mvn clean install

mvn clean compile

---

### 4.Run the Application

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.MultiUserExpenseTracker"
        OR
mvn exec:java

---

### How It Works

# Login or Register as a new user.

# Add your income to set your available balance.

# Add expenses with description and amount.

# View your expenses anytime â€” data is user-specific.

---

### Notes

# The target/ directory is not pushed to GitHub (it's auto-generated by Maven).

# After cloning, always run mvn clean compile (or install) to regenerate target/.

# Make sure your Oracle database is running before starting the app.
